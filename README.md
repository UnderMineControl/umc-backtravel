# UnderMineControl - BackTravel
This is a port of the [UnderMod BackTravel mod](https://github.com/bwdymods/UM-BackTravel).

BackTravel is a mod for UnderMine that allows fast travel to previous zones via the Cartographer (as opposed to only traveling to later zones). It could easily be considered unbalanced; balance is something that will be explored in the later versions.

## Features
* When fast traveling via the Cartographer, you will now have access to previous cleared zones instead of only later zones.
* You will arrive at a new instance of the previous zone, not the one you already cleared and looted.
* Requires [UnderMineControl](https://github.com/calico-crusade/underminecontrol)
* Notably, as there is no Map for the Goldmines, the Cartographer does not offer travel there, or to the Hub.
* Hitting the key NumPad1 will show all zones via the Cartographer. 
	* This is mostly for testing purposes, use at your own risk.
	* Hitting the key again will hide any zones that have not been traveled to.
